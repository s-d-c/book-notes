The purpose of this app is to allow a user, once logged in, to search books using the data from goodreads' api.  The user would then select books to add to "My Books" with the intention of adding notes, quotes, etc associated with the book to that book's page on the app.  The notes are stored in the database and displayed on each book's page along with a text box to continue storing notes.

It uses the goodreads api for info on the books.
